wslay 0.1.0
===========

Release Note
------------

This is the initial release of wslay WebSocket C library.

Wslay is a WebSocket library written in C. It implements the protocol
version 13 described in RFC 6455. This library offers 2 levels of API:
event-based API and frame-based low-level API. For event-based API, it
is suitable for non-blocking reactor pattern style. You can set
callbacks in various events. For frame-based API, you can send
WebSocket frame directly. Wslay only supports data transfer part of
WebSocket protocol and does not perform opening handshake in HTTP.

Wslay does not perform any I/O operations for its own. Instead, it
offers callbacks for them. This makes Wslay independent on any I/O
frameworks, SSL, sockets, etc. This makes Wslay protable across
various platforms and the application authors can choose freely IO
frameworks.

Visit http://wslay.sourceforge.net/ for the API reference and
tutorial.
