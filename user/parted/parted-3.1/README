GNU Parted
----------

GNU Parted is a program for manipulating partition tables.

WARNING: USING PARTED TO PERFORM FILE SYSTEM OPERATIONS IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parted (post-2.4) no longer has the ability to create and modify file systems.
Use file-system-specific tools to create and operate on file systems.
For example, use the e2fsprogs programs to operate on ext2, ext3 and ext4
file systems.  Use programs from the reiserfsprogs package if you want to
manipulate reiserfs file systems.  Although Parted lets you do some of the
same things, the file-system-related code in parted is not as robust as the
code in more specialized, FS-specific packages.

Most FS-related functionality was removed after Parted 2.4.
Thus, the following commands are no longer supported:
mkpartfs, mkfs, cp, move, check, resize.


See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.


 * documentation is in the doc/ directory.  The User's documentation is in
texinfo format, and is built into a format viewable by info/pinfo when
you run make.  To view the distributed texinfo documentation, run this:

	$ info -f parted.info

NOTE TO DISTRIBUTIONS
---------------------

(1) When compiling Parted for distribution for general use, we recommend using
the default configuration:

	CFLAGS=-Os ./configure

This includes --enable-debug (by default), which contains many assertions.
Obviously, these "waste" space, but in the past, they have caught potentially
dangerous bugs before they would have done damage, so we think it's worth
it.  Also, it means we get more bug reports ;)


(2) When doing dependencies, remember that libreiserfs is a *soft* dependency,
so I guess that means Debian-look-alikes should do a "suggests", but
not a "requires".


(3) When space is important, we suggest --without-readline, --disable-shared,
and possibly --disable-nls and --disable-dynamic-loading.
