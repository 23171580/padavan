Change Log
==========

All notable changes to the project are documented in this file.

[1.99.15][] - 2015-09-09
------------------------

Minor bugfix release.

### Changes
- Support for new API at https://tunnelbroker.net, fixes issue #83.
  Use `default@tunnelbroker.net` to use the DYN.com API to update
  the IPv4 address for your IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel.  Thanks goes to
  Horst Venzke @hvenzke for reporting this problem!
- The old API for the IPv6-in-IPv4 system `ipv6tb@he.net` is now
  deprecated.  Users should migrate to `default@tunnelbroker.net`
- Files generated by the GNU Configure & Build System is now no longer
  stored in GIT.  Instead, users that rely on GIT must run the new
  `./autogen.sh` script to generate the necessary files (`configure`).


### Fixes
- Fix issue #100: regression from [1.99.13][] pidfile is no longer
  created.  Inadyn 1.x semantics incompatible with OpenBSD `pidfile()`
  that replaced local version in [1.99.14][].  Problem found by David
  Schury @daersc.
- Fix issue #107: If an IP address update fails, e.g. due to temporary
  connectivity, HTTP transmission problems, etc. then Inadyn now forces
  an update in the next IP check cycle.  (This is the configurable
  `period` interval in `inadyn.conf`.)  Reported by Oliver Graute
  @redbrain17 and audited by @BulldozerBSG, thanks!
- Fix issue #108: Update README with correct alias syntax for Namecheap,
  issue reported by @quazar0


[1.99.14][] - 2015-07-14
------------------------

Improved support for configuring custom DDNS providers and support for
running in Windows, using Cygwin!

### Changes
- New setting `append-myip` which, instead of appending your hostname
  alias, appends the current IP to the server GET update URL.  See
  [README][README.md] or the man pages for more details.
- Prevent Inadyn from bugging out if it cannot write a cache file when
  the `-o, --once` flag is given.
- Add support for <http://GiraDNS.com>, thanks to Thorsten MÃ¼hlfelder!
- Add support for <https://www.duiadns.net>, thanks to Ionut Slaveanu!

### Fixes

  to Frank Aurich for this work!

  regression introduced in [1.99.13][].
