This file is required by the GNU Configure and Build System.  However,
for the Inadyn project the NEWS file has been superceeded by CHANGELOG.

The change log file is what will be kept up to date and detail changes
to the project, in a human readable format.  For details on each change
the reader is recommended to read the GIT log.
