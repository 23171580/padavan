Linux 2.4.x kernel users
------------------------

Support for 2.4.x kernels has been experimentally dropped.  It has been over
three years since 2.6.x kernels have been supported, and I'm not sure how many
people still use 2.4 kernels.

None of the kernel changes in this release are applicable to 2.4 kernels, and
the previous releases (3.0, 3.1, 3.1-r2) can mount filesystems generated by this
release.  If in later releases the filesystem format changes so it becomes
unmountable by 2.4 kernels, I will probably release new 2.4 kernel patches then.
